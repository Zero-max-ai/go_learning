# DAY 3 for GO LEARNING

### if statment syntax
```
if condition {}
else {}
```


### for loops
```
for i:=0; i<5; i++ {}

: It's fucking infinite loop
for {}

: It's like while loop
for condition {}
```

### switch statments
```
switch exp {
    case vak1: // code
    case vak2: //code
    default: //code
}
```

go language does not have while loop like c++ does && to mimic while loop like feature its done by a for loop
```
for i<=5 {
    //code
}
```
